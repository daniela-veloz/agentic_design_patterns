      "Dogs are domesticated mammals and are one of the most popular pets worldwide. They are known for their loyalty, companionship, and ability to perform various roles such as herding, hunting, guarding, and assisting police and military. Dogs come in a wide variety of breeds, each with unique characteristics and traits. They are often referred to as \"man's best friend\" due to their close relationship with humans.\n"
